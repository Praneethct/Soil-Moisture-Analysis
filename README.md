Prediction of Soil Moisture using Hyperspectral bands.
Performed Descriptive Data Analysis on the soil data.
Checked for null values in the data.
Computed Correlation of bandwidths to soil moisture to check for the relation between them.
Visualised the data by computing pricipal components of the bandwidths into 1 component which makes it easy.
